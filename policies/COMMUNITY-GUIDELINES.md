# Community Guidelines

As a community we want to create an environment that allows ALL JavaScript-ers to feel welcome. By joining this community you agree to adhere to these guidelines.

We will use the [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) RFC for these guidelines.

## The Guidelines

### Adhere to Polywork core guidelines

We adhere strictly to [Polywork Guidelines](https://www.polywork.com/community-guidelines).

- Members **MUST** adhere to all [Polywork Guidelines](https://www.polywork.com/community-guidelines)

### All levels welcome

We welcome all levels from beginner all the way to Brendan Eich (he wrote JS).

- Members **MUST** welcome all levels of JavaScript knowledge
- Members **MUST NOT** use terminology based on an individuals level (i.e. noob)

### Focus on Code

We are JavaScript group, and we will focus on the JavaScript and related technologies. 

- Members **SHOULD** relate all posts to technology
- Members **SHOULD NO**T post about outside technologies 

### No Selling

We want to build a community that invites learning, sharing of knowledge and not a primary place to sell to JS engineers. We also know that this is the real world and a lot of times the cool stuff people are building is at work or paid in nature. In addition, we understand with all these awesome devs in one place it might be a good place to hire someone or post about needing a job. We will allow this (for now) but depending on the amount, might open up a different avenue (i.e. a Job Board). For now follow the below:

- Members **MUST NOT** post about products, services with the intention of selling said product
- Members **MAY** post asking for help and other members **MAY** respond, including in the context of paid services
- Members **MAY** post about open jobs they are hiring for or **MAY** post if they are looking for a job
- Members **MAY** share projects they are working, including paid products they built
- Members **MAY** share projects from their work or information
- The Community **MAY** at times have sponsors that will share limited information about their services

## Enforcement

Depending on the severity of the infraction the process detailed below will be followed. In cases where the infraction is severe we will skip to the immediate end of the process and ban the member (in addition to reporting to Polywork if deemed necessary).

A founders sign-off is required to ban an individual, unless at least 2 moderators agree to ban and individual. The founders & moderators will review all removals at their monthly meeting.

### The Process

1. **Warning** - a warning will be DM'd to the individual that they have broken XYZ guideline(s) and given a chance to remedy the situtation.
2. **Second Warning** - a second warning will be DM'd that declares this is the final warning.
3. **Removal** - immediate removal from the community (& possibly reported to Polywork depending on the severity).

### Removal of Content

The founders & moderators reserve the right to remove content that does not adhere to our guidelines.
